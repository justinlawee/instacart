# Instacart Reorder Prediction
#
# This project builds the data transformation layer for an end-to-end AI-powered
# reorder prediction pipeline using Snowflake. It includes:
# - Raw Instacart data ingestion and staging
# - Feature engineering and aggregation using dbt
# - ML-ready outputs consumed by Snowpark for model training
#
# The project is part of a larger AI workflow that also includes:
# - Model training with Snowpark Python (Random Forest / XGBoost)
# - Prediction outputs stored in Snowflake
# - Optional GenAI enrichment with Cortex
# - Visualization in Snowsight
